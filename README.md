## General Information
- Project Information: This is a Case-study Project on Data Analysis. This case study aims to give an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, We are working with the loan application data from a big lending company.

- Project Background: The lending company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 

- Business Problem: The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

- Dataset: The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club.


## Conclusions
- Major driving factors behind 'loan default':

  1. Term
  2. Interest Rate
  3. Debt to Income ratio
  4. Annual Income
  5. Purpose
  6. Public derogatory/bankruptcy records

- Recommended actions:

  1. LC should focus on 36 months term loans more than 60 months term loans.
  2. LC should think about reducing interest rate for their very high interest rate loans as they are showing high default tendency.
  3. LC should take special care in verifying borrowers from Nebraska, Nevada, Idaho and Alaska, as they have a higher percentage of defaults.
  4. LC should review their verification process since verified loans are having slightly more default percentage which is not expected.
  5. LC should check the number of open credit lines and the utilization of the revolving balance for the credit lines.
  6. Small business and renewable energy loans should be scrutinized more as they have high default tendency.
  7. LC should review the sub-grading for F5, G3 and G4 loans. G3 and F5 sub-grade can be shifted to the lower sub-grade in G and G4 can be shifted to higher sub-grade in F.
